## every_enby 🖤💜🤍💛

`every_enby` is a Twitter bot that I built in my spare time, just for funsies. 

It pulls a random word from the [Wordnik API](https://developer.wordnik.com/) `randomwords` endpoint and combines it with either the word "enby" or "non-binary" to create funny little non-binary personas and representations. 

Tweets are sent out at regular half hour intervals using a timed loop. 

This bot was heavily inspired by everybisexual and every_lesbian.
